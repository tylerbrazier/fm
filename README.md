# fm File Manager

Use your browser to manage local files, view images, and play music.

I'd like to write the backend using deno
but it currently doesn't run on termux;
or even better use File System Access API
(<https://web.dev/file-system-access/>)
when that's supported on mobile.

## Developing

	npx nodemon server.js
	npx eslint .
